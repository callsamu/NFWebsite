                              - If it's "words", simplify the content to the specified number of words.
                              - If it's "percent", reduce the content by the specified percentage of the original content's length.
                              - If it's "characters", shorten the content to the specified number of characters.
                              - If it's "sentences", condense the content to the specified number of sentences.
                              
                              Respond using Markdown formatting, and add in headers and different sized or fonted text to be visually appealing. Make sure to add in sufficient whitespace for clarity.`,
